            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a London based software engineer who loves building web applications in highly collaborative teams.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have over a decade of experience building full-stack web applications. My expertise centres on using
                the .NET stack in cloud environments, but I always embrace the opportunity to try new technologies.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to building web applications, I have a particular passion for:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Automating boring tasks</li>
                <li>Building cloud infrastructure as code</li>
                <li>Finding, exploiting and securing software vulnerabilities</li>
                <li>Leading and empowering engineering teams</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
