<h2>About me</h2>
<p>
    I am a London based software engineer who loves building web applications in highly collaborative teams.
</p>
<p>
    I have over a decade of experience building full-stack web applications. My expertise centres on using
    the .NET stack in cloud environments, but I always embrace the opportunity to try new technologies.
</p>
<p>
    In addition to building web applications, I have a particular passion for:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Automating boring tasks</li>
    <li>Building cloud infrastructure as code</li>
    <li>Finding, exploiting and securing software vulnerabilities</li>
    <li>Leading and empowering engineering teams</li>
</ul>
