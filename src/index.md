## About me

I am a London based software engineer who loves building web applications in highly collaborative teams.

I have over 15 years of experience building full-stack web applications. My expertise centres on using the .NET stack in cloud environments, but I always embrace the opportunity to try new technologies.

In addition to building web applications, I have a particular passion for:

- Automating boring tasks
- Building cloud infrastructure as code
- Finding, exploiting and securing software vulnerabilities
- Leading and empowering engineering teams
- Boosting productivity with LLMs

I write about various topics on [inkyvoxel.com](https://www.inkyvoxel.com?ref=markbrady.net), including software engineering, cybersecurity, and leadership.

You can also find me on [X](https://x.com/inkyvoxel), [GitHub](https://github.com/inkyvoxel), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/m7y).

Content and opinions on this website are my own.
