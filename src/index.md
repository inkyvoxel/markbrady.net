## About me

I am a London based software engineer who loves building web applications in highly collaborative teams.

I have over 15 years of experience building full-stack web applications. My expertise centres on using the .NET stack in cloud environments, but I always embrace the opportunity to try new technologies.

In addition to building web applications, I have a particular passion for:

- Automating boring tasks
- Building cloud infrastructure as code
- Finding, exploiting and securing software vulnerabilities
- Leading and empowering engineering teams

I write about various topics on [inkyvoxel.com](https://www.inkyvoxel.com), including software engineering, cybersecurity, and leadership.

You can also find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/m7y), [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@inkyvoxel) and [GitHub](https://github.com/inkyvoxel).

Content and opinions on this website are my own.
