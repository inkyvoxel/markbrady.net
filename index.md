## About me

I am a London based software engineer who loves building web applications in highly collaborative teams.

I have over a decade of experience building full-stack web applications. My expertise centres on using the .NET stack in cloud environments, but I always embrace the opportunity to try new technologies.

In addition to building web applications, I have a particular passion for:
- Automating boring tasks
- Building cloud infrastructure as code
- Finding, exploiting and securing software vulnerabilities
- Leading and empowering engineering teams

I write about software engineering, cybersecurity and leadership on <a href="https://www.inkyvoxel.com">inkyvoxel.com</a>.
