    <h1 class="title">Hey, I am Mark Brady! ðŸ‘‹</h1>
    <p>
      I am a London based software engineer who loves building web applications 
      in highly collaborative teams.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have been building full stack web applications for over 10 years. 
      Most of my experience has been building software using the .NET stack, 
      but I always enjoy learning new technologies.
    </p>
    <p>
      My main interests are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Automating boring tasks</li>
      <li>Building infrastructure as code</li>
      <li>Finding and securing software vulnerabilities</li>
      <li>Leading teams and coaching others</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I write about software engineering, cyber security and leadership 
      on <a href="https://www.inkyvoxel.com" target="_blank">inkyvoxel.com</a>.
