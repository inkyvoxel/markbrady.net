      My name is Mark Brady. I have been building web applications for over 10 years. 
      Most of my experience is with building software using the .NET stack.

      I have a keen interest in automation, DevOps culture, cyber security and 
      using open source software. I am very passionate about leadership, 
      coaching and working in highly collaborative teams.

      Outside of work I enjoy cooking new recipes, and eating large portions of food. 
      When I get the opportunity, I love to travel. Sometimes I exercise.
