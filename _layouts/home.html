    <h1 class="title">Hey, I am Mark Brady! ðŸ‘‹</h1>
    <p>
      I am a London based software engineer who loves building web applications 
      in highly collaborative teams.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have over a decade of experience building full-stack web applications. 
      My expertise mainly centers on using the .NET stack on cloud hosting, 
      but I always embrace the opportunity to try new technologies.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to building web applications, I have a particular passion for:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Learning new stuff</li>
      <li>Automating boring tasks</li>
      <li>Building infrastructure as code</li>
      <li>Finding, exploiting and securing software vulnerabilities</li>
      <li>Leading and empowering engineering teams</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
